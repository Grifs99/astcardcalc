<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>This is a tool to calculate the optimal target for Astrologian cards in Final Fantasy XIV</p>

<h2>Does it account for...</h2>

<p>Generally, yes. Specifically it accounts for these commonly asked things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Includes pet damage</li>
    <li>Excludes the 3%/4%/6%/8% damage buff from the card
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted before the card window</li>
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted after the card window</li>
    <li>Includes ticks from DoTs snapshotted inside the card window, including ticks that happen afterward</li>
    <li>Includes the portion of Wildfire damage generated by damage inside the tether window (Stormblood logs only)</li>
    <li>Includes damage from ground effect DoTs (Shadow Flare, Doton, Salted Earth, Flamethrower)</li>
    <li>Includes damage from Radiant Shield (when applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>This is the methodology used by the script for each tether window</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get all of the non-tick, direct damage inside the card window (typically 15s) for each player</li>
    <li>Walk through each debuff and tick event.
        <ul>
            <li>While inside the window, keep a list of every debuff application we see. Remove debuffs that fade</li>
            <li>For every tick, add it only if there's been an application of that debuff inside the window</li>
            <li>For Stormblood wildfire, take 25% of the damage done inside the card window, if card was only up for some part of it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Take out the appropriate bonus to the player that actually receieved the card based on what card was played and the job of the receiving player</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing all of that, the result is an accurate representation of the <strong>total amount of damage that would have been buffed by the card</strong>, if that player were its target at the time it was originally played.</p>

<h2>Current limitations</h2>
<p>Currently the analysis of whether the card was played "optimally" is fairly simple. It doesn't do any of the following (yet):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look for a better time to play the card during the same Draw window</li>
    <li>Look for whether a card overwrote another</li>
    <li>Look at whether a Lord/Lady usage should have been swapped with a normal card usage elsewhere in the same Divination window</li>
    <li>Look at whether you should have tried to Redraw for a card of the opposite melee/ranged type</li>
    <li>There is no consideration of what seals you have currently or ned for your next Divination</li>
    <li>If multiple cards are active at the same time players that have cards are ignored for the later card plays without checking if an alternative play order would have been more optimal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who made this?</h2>

<p>This projected was adapted from the tethercalc project made by Platinum Xephera on the Ultros server who graciously let me use their code as a starting point. It's currently managed by Marielle Kaidafaux on Adamantoise. I made it because I wanted a tool to examine optimal targets for cards while playing Astrologian. I hope the {{ report_count }} analyzed reports have been useful.</p>
<p>If you notice any issues, feel free to DM me through Discord (Melody â™«#1653), or open issues and pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/meldontaragon/astcardcalc">GitHub repo</a> for this site.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>2021-01-15: Fixed pet tick damage (such as SMN Ifrit Enkindle DoT) not being correctly included in the damage total for that player. Fixed in git commit <a href="https://github.com/meldontaragon/astcardcalc/commit/1eafff25d498ff95ad170294967a1b98c32ef90d">1eafff2</a></p>
