<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>This is a tool to calculate the optimal target for Astrologian cards in Final Fantasy XIV</p>

<h2>Does it account for...</h2>

<p>Generally, yes. Specifically it accounts for these commonly asked things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Includes pet damage</li>
    <li>Excludes the 3%/4%/6%/8% damage buff from the card
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted before the card window</li>
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted after the card window</li>
    <li>Includes ticks from DoTs snapshotted inside the card window, including ticks that happen afterward</li>
    <li>Includes damage from ground effect DoTs (Shadow Flare, Doton, Salted Earth, Flamethrower)</li>
    <li>Includes damage from Radiant Shield (when applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>This is the methodology used by the script for each tether window</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get all of the non-tick, direct damage inside the 15 second window for each player</li>
    <li>Walk through each debuff and tick event.
        <ul>
            <li>While inside the window, keep a list of every debuff application we see. Remove debuffs that fade</li>
            <li>For every tick, add it only if there's been an application of that debuff inside the window</li>
            <li>For Stormblood wildfire, take 25% of the damage done inside the card window, if card was only up for some part of it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Take out the appropriate bonus to the player that actually receieved the card based on what card was played and the job of the receiving player</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing all of that, the result is an accurate representation of the <strong>total amount of damage that would have been buffed by the card</strong>, if that player were its target at the time it was originally played.</p>

<h2>Who made this?</h2>

<p>This project is heavily based on the tethercalc project from Platinum Xephera on the Ultros server. This was adapted by Marielle Kaidafaux on Adamantoise because there didn't exist a good tool to examine optimal targets for cards while playing astroligian. I hope the {{ report_count }} analyzed reports have been useful.</p>
<p>If you notice any issues, feel free to DM me through Discord (Melody â™«#1653), or open issues and pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/meldontaragon/astcardcalc">GitHub repo</a> for this site.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>2021-01-15: Fixed pet tick damage (such as SMN Ifrit Enkindle DoT) not being correctly included in the damage total for that player. Fixed in git commit <a href="https://github.com/meldontaragon/astcardcalc/commit/1eafff25d498ff95ad170294967a1b98c32ef90d">1eafff2</a></p>
